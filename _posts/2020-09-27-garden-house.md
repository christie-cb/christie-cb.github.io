We were lucky enough to stay in this gorgeous house for a week and we loved every minute of it - on the last day we even spoke about how much we wanted to stay longer! It's very rare for a holiday home to have cleaners coming daily, so we were very pleasantly surprised when a lady came to clean every day and she made the house look lovely! She was nice and friendly and insanely efficient too. To keep up the gorgeous garden, there was also a gardener - all these staff were super polite and helpful and their work really sets this apart from other places. We felt very safe and secure (the diligent staff always made sure the doors were properly locked behind us) and were able to relax knowing the housework was taken care of!

Situated in a quiet little village in the Cotswolds, a short drive from the town Lechlade-on-Thames, this peaceful sanctuary still kept us entertained constantly. From the creative garden features (like the beautiful spiral hedge with a table in the center) to the spacious living rooms and projector screen, there was never a dull moment while we were staying here. Not only was the house fun in itself, there are also loads of wonderful places to visit nearby.  


## What's nearby?

While we were here we did our old favourite Cotswolds activities! Plenty of beautiful walks, eating cake in the Ox Barn at Thyme, pizza from Sourdough Revolution in Lechlade and fantastic sourdough from Lynwood & Co. But we also tried out some new exciting activies (especially to keep the little ones entertained) like visiting a fantastic zoo which was only a 10-minute drive away ([Cotswolds Wildlife Park](https://www.cotswoldwildlifepark.co.uk/ "Cotswold Wildlife Park and Gardens, Burford") and baking apple crumble from the apple tree in the garden!

### To summarise...
To do in nearby towns
* Burford: Great for walks, great food shops along the high street, Lynwood & Co cafe, and a little river with ducks!
* Eastleach: Beautiful little village with access to stunning walks, and the famous Victoria Inn up the hill.
* Lechlade: Closest place to get groceries, nice restaurants (recommend Sourdough Revolution and of course Lynwood & Co), great pubs (I love the Trout Inn and The Riverside, which has a great outdoors area for sunny days.) and a good walk along the Thames.
And in Lechlade there's a year-round Christmas Shop!
* Southrop: the Thyme complex with the Ox Bar, the Baa and the The Swan pub.

To do at home
* Visit the chickens, and check whether they've laid any fresh eggs! During our stay the cute chickens graced us with about 2 eggs a day!
* Pick apples from the garden and bake an apple crumble
* Watch movies from the projector
* We brought a puzzle, and usually also bring board games
* Go on long walks! Â
