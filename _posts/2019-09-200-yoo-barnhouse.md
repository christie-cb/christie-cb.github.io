The famous one, designed by Kate Moss. It was incredible! Staying here was as lovely and exciting as we'd hoped.
When you walk in you immediately see a striking photo gallery wall of cool  pictures of celebrities and Kate Moss herself and this theme is maintained very consistently throughout the entire house. It's desperately cool and guaranteed to make you feel a little bit like a rockstar.
The Lakes By Yoo is always fantastic, and every time we've been we have had a great experience. It's situated in a lovely spot surrounded by lakes, forests and countryside which makes it a perfect escape from busy city life. Lakes by Yoo is set apart by it's modern design which lies in stark contrast to the typical 'country living' themes of other holiday spots in The Cotswolds. 
These modern interiors give rise to heaps of comfort, luxury and convienience which is sometimes lacking when you stay in cute, old properties more typical of the area. 
This was our second stay at Yoo and we were not disappointed in the least!

### FACTILITIES AT LAKES BY YOO

Lakes by Yoo has a gym, pool and playground as well as the yurt which sells cocktails, coffees and pizza. These are all great fun, and the staff made us feel incredibly welcome. Near the yurt is a little fake beach where we spent one afternoon building sandcastles and skimming stones on the lake.

For more info on the facilites at Yoo, see my previous blogpost on the Huntsman lodge, which we were lucky enough to stay in during April 2019. 

### THINGS TO DO IN THE AREA 

Whilst we were here we greatly enjoyed our OS maps walks into the countryside and often ventured into Lechlade. As we were lucky enough to visit during a hot spell in September, we sat outside at the pub and enjoyed watching the swans go by.

Of course, the Barnhouse has a pool which provided us with plenty of entertainment.
