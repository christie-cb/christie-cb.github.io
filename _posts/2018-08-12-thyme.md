# Old Walls Cottage - A Review 

## About 

Thyme is a beautiful village in Southrop, with comfy furnishings and great food at both the Ox Barn and the Swan Pub. In the last week of March, 2018 we enjoyed a stay at the Old Walls Cottage - the only stay in Thyme which accomodates dogs and children. We stayed here with Oscar (the great big labradoodle pictured below) and Annabelle, who was only abound 2 months old at this time! 


Old Walls was comfortable and cozy and boasted an impressive garden and access to Thyme's restaurants. We were able to get chef-made food (see these doorstep sandwiches below) delivered to the cottage, and drink in the Baa which was a very short walk from our front door. The Baa was a great place to relax with cocktails, board games and magazines (as well as the big fluffy sheep statues!).

Meadow Spa (a part of Thyme) was also very nearby, and offered amazing massages and facials! They offer a number of treatments in a really beautiful setting.

## Children and dogs

Thyme is located in a perfect spot for long walks, which Oscar enjoyed greatly!

## Garden

The garden was beautiful and had so many different little sections. It was great fun to walk around and great for Oscar. From the conservatory there was a lovely view, and a field of sheep backed onto the garden.
